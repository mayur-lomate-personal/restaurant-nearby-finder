### **Project Description: MongoDB Geospatial Database for Nearby Restaurant Finder**

This project leverages MongoDB as the core geospatial database to implement a **Nearby Restaurant Finder** system. MongoDB's robust geospatial capabilities enable efficient storage, indexing, and querying of location-based data, making it an ideal choice for building location-aware applications.

---

### **MongoDB as a Geospatial Database:**

MongoDB provides several **geospatial query operators** to work with geospatial data stored in GeoJSON format or as legacy coordinate pairs. These operators enable efficient querying of location-based data and support advanced geospatial computations. Below is an explanation of all the geospatial query operators with examples.

---

### **1. `$near`**

- Finds documents that are closest to a specified point.
- Requires a **2dsphere index** for GeoJSON objects or a **2d index** for legacy coordinate pairs.
- Can include an optional `$maxDistance` or `$minDistance` parameter to limit results by distance.

**Example: Find restaurants near a point (within 1 km):**
```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
    location: {
        $near: {
            $geometry: {
                type: "Point",
                coordinates: [77.07576312, 28.51150832]
            },
            $maxDistance: 1000
        }
    }
});
```

---

### **2. `$geoWithin`**

- Finds documents with geometries that are **entirely within** a specified shape.
- The shape can be a **polygon**, a **circle**, or other GeoJSON-defined geometries.

**Example: Find restaurants within a circular area:**
```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
    location: {
        $geoWithin: {
            $centerSphere: [[77.07576312, 28.51150832], 1 / 6378.1] // 1 km radius in radians
        }
    }
});
```

**Example: Find restaurants within a polygon:**
```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
    location: {
        $geoWithin: {
            $geometry: {
                type: "Polygon",
                coordinates: [[
                    [77.072, 28.510],
                    [77.078, 28.510],
                    [77.078, 28.515],
                    [77.072, 28.515],
                    [77.072, 28.510] // Polygon must be closed
                ]]
            }
        }
    }
});
```

---

### **3. `$geoIntersects`**

- Finds documents where geometries **intersect** with a specified shape.
- Useful for finding objects that touch or overlap a shape.

**Example: Find restaurants that intersect a line:**
```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
    location: {
        $geoIntersects: {
            $geometry: {
                type: "LineString",
                coordinates: [
                    [77.072, 28.510],
                    [77.078, 28.515]
                ]
            }
        }
    }
});
```

---

### **4. `$nearSphere`**

- Similar to `$near`, but specifically for spherical calculations.
- Finds documents closest to a point on a spherical surface.

**Example: Find the nearest restaurants to a point using spherical calculations:**
```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
    location: {
        $nearSphere: {
            $geometry: {
                type: "Point",
                coordinates: [77.07576312, 28.51150832]
            },
            $maxDistance: 2000 // 2 km
        }
    }
});
```

---

### **5. `$center`** (Legacy Operator)

- Used with **2d indexes** to find documents within a circular region.
- **Not recommended for new applications.**

**Example: Find restaurants within a 1 km radius:**
```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
    location: {
        $geoWithin: {
            $center: [[77.07576312, 28.51150832], 1] // Radius in degrees
        }
    }
});
```

---

### **6. `$centerSphere`**

- Used to find documents within a circular area on a spherical surface.
- Radius is specified in radians.

**Example: Find restaurants within a 1 km radius (spherical):**
```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
    location: {
        $geoWithin: {
            $centerSphere: [[77.07576312, 28.51150832], 1 / 6378.1] // Earth's radius in km
        }
    }
});
```

---

### **7. `$box`** (Legacy Operator)

- Finds documents within a rectangular area.
- Works with **2d indexes**.

**Example: Find restaurants within a bounding box:**
```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
    location: {
        $geoWithin: {
            $box: [[77.070, 28.510], [77.080, 28.520]]
        }
    }
});
```

---

### **8. `$polygon`**

- Finds documents within a polygon shape.
- Polygon must be a **closed shape**.

**Example: Find restaurants within a triangular polygon:**
```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
    location: {
        $geoWithin: {
            $geometry: {
                type: "Polygon",
                coordinates: [[
                    [77.072, 28.510],
                    [77.078, 28.510],
                    [77.075, 28.515],
                    [77.072, 28.510]
                ]]
            }
        }
    }
});
```

---

### **9. `$maxDistance` and `$minDistance`**

- Used with `$near` and `$nearSphere` to define a range of distances for the query.

**Example: Find restaurants between 1 km and 2 km from a point:**
```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
    location: {
        $near: {
            $geometry: {
                type: "Point",
                coordinates: [77.07576312, 28.51150832]
            },
            $minDistance: 1000, // 1 km
            $maxDistance: 2000  // 2 km
        }
    }
});
```

---

### **10. `$geometry`**

- Specifies the GeoJSON object (e.g., `Point`, `Polygon`, `LineString`) for geospatial operations.

**Example: Used with `$near`:**
```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
    location: {
        $near: {
            $geometry: {
                type: "Point",
                coordinates: [77.07576312, 28.51150832]
            }
        }
    }
});
```

### **Best Practices for MongoDB Geospatial Queries:**

1. **Use 2dsphere Index:**
   Ensure a `2dsphere` index is created on the geospatial field to leverage MongoDB's geospatial features.

   ```javascript
   db.restaurants.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" });
   ```

2. **Use GeoJSON Format:**
   Store geospatial data in **GeoJSON format** for compatibility with advanced geospatial queries.

3. **Avoid Legacy Operators:**
   Prefer GeoJSON-based queries over legacy operators like `$center` and `$box` for new applications.

4. **Optimize Query Performance:**
    - Combine geospatial queries with other filters (e.g., restaurant type, rating) to limit results.
    - Use pagination for large result sets.

MongoDB's geospatial query operators enable efficient and flexible handling of location-based data, making it a powerful choice for geospatial applications like the **Nearby Restaurant Finder**.
